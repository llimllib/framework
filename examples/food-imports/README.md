# Food Imports

View live: <https://observablehq.observablehq.cloud/framework-example-food-imports/>

This page displays statistics about food imports to the United States.

## Charts

This dashboard combines three chart types to highlight different facets of the data. The first two charts are made with [D3](https://d3js.org/) components and limit data to 2023. The [Marimekko chart](https://observablehq.com/@d3/marimekko-chart) displays the portion of edible imports by country of origin and category; and the [Sunburst chart]() shows which commodities make up each category. The third chart uses [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/plot/) to visualize each country's total food exports to the US over time.
